## Step 0: Downloading tools for Development environment

npm i -g react-native-cli

npm i -g react-native

brew install cocoapods

node version used : v18.19.1

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

```bash

# using npm
npm start

```

## Step 2: Start your Application

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.


## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:

### Now what?

Happy Coding Guys !!
